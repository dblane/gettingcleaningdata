#Getting And Cleaning Data Peer Assessment
#### This readme describes the way the script works

1. Once you have the 'run_analysis.R' script in your working directory you can use it to download, unzip and create a tidydata set.
2. Use source("run_analysis.R") command in RStudio.
3. You will now have a new file created called tidydata.txt.
4. Since we are required to get the average of each variable for each activity and each subject, and there are 6 activities in total and 30 subjects in total, we have 180 rows with all combinations for each of the 66 features.
